At this stage, we need to analyse numerous elements involved with libspotify_embedded, including the following:

The Web API:

- We need to look into how libspotify communicates with Spotify servers. As mentioned by @plietar, the communication seems to be based on protobuf, and we believe it to be controlled by GAIA, a proprietary communication protocol found in libspotify_embedded. This will need to be reversed and documented if we are to be able to stream audio.
For info on the protobuf schemas, have a look at the work on this repo: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-spotify-web and here: https://gist.github.com/adammw/9706428
N.B. We do not know if these schemas are the same used in libspotify_embedded, but the debug output suggests they are.

- Spotify Connect control. this also looks like it is controlled through GAIA, via SpircManager. It appears that once a connection to a Connect speaker has been done over the local network, all playback control is done through Spotify servers. Again, this needs to be reversed and documented.

-API endpoints. We don't know if these are different from the ones used by desktop Spotify and play.spotify.com, so any information and documentation on that would be helpful.

The Libspotify_Embedded library:

-Function documentation. a list of the main functions can be found here: http://divideoverflow.com/2014/08/reversing-spotify-connect/ but this is by no means exhaustive. Thorough documentation and code is definitely needed before we can think of getting a stable, working solution in place.
@plietar has already started work here: https://github.com/plietar/spotify-connect, a copy of which is available here: https://github.com/sashahilton00/spotify-connect-resources/tree/master/spotify-connect so by all means continue development on that. NB. It is @plietar's work, copied here for centralization purposes.

Any other contributions regarding libspotify_embedded are also welcome, just submit a pr to the repo ;)
For the sake of consistency, please use the rocki or powernode libspotify_embedded where possible, so that we all have the same environment, and (mostly) do not run into errors that differ due to different libraries.

Please post any useful info to the gitter chat, found here: https://gitter.im/sashahilton00/spotify-connect-resources as it just makes keeping track of development much easier.

More updates coming soon, once we have a grip on the current things that need to be done.
