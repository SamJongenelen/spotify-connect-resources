# spotify-connect-resources
A repository to hold any data/stuff related to reversing the Spotify Connect protocol. Mostly just data dumps at the moment, but if you have something to add to it, be it an implementation, information or just another data dump, make a PR and I will add it asap.

Currently this repo holds a few data dumps, and links t other sites which have also made headway on reversing the Connect protocol. Due to the current lack of common meeting ground atm, I have created this repo, so please feel free to PR anything Connect related. Also, you are encouraged to join the Spotify Connect room on Gitter, as it is by far the easiest wat to connect with others interested in reversing Connect, and keeping up with current progress. The room is available here:

anycontributions welcome. I will try and setup some sort of Roadmap based on what we currently know in the coming days.
