Hopefully one of you guys will be able to progress development of an open Spotify Connect protocol, 
as unfortunately I do not have the time. I would love to see an open Spotify Connect protocol at some point,
hopefully even get something running on my Pi! Anyway, here are the files that I extracted from a speaker,
including the Spotify Connect lib. The files of interest look to be:

libspotify_embedded_shared.so.1.8.0
sovi-spotify
SpotifyCodec.pm

But I have left a bunch more stuff in there, incase you want to pry around ;) Not going to upload the entire firmware,
as it is pretty large, unless there is big demand for it. BTW, if you make any progress on it, please post it for others to
see and advance, on Github or something, and please drop a line in the comments over at:

http://divideoverflow.com/2014/08/reversing-spotify-connect/
and here:
http://divideoverflow.com/2015/02/update_on_spotify_connect_protocol_reversing/

For lack of better place to have some sort of centralised conversation. I will be checking the comments every now and then, so if you need anything
else from me, leave a comment. BTW, I am not the author/owner of divideoverflow.com, it just seems like a logical place to
discuss this as this is where the bulk of the work has been done so far.

Happy hacking ;)
